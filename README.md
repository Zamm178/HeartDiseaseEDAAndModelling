# HeartDiseaseEDAAndModelling
Exploratory data analysis was performed on the Kaggle Heart Disease UCI dataset, using different data visualizations. Three models were tested: the K Neighbors Model, Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier. Random Forest Classifier was found to be the best model out of the three, with an accuracy of 78%. A Heroku Web application that predicts whether someone is at risk of heart disease or not will follow.
